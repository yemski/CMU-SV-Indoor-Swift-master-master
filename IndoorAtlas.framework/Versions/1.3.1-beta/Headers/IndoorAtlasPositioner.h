 *
 *    - kIndoorAtlasPositioningStateConnecting
 *
 *      Positioner is connecting to the positioning server.
 *      This state only emits when connecting first time to the server.
 *
 *    - kIndoorAtlasPositioningStateReconnecting,
 *
 *      Positioner is reconnecting to the positioning server.
 *      This state may emit when switching from WiFi -> Mobile network or because of network problem.
 *
 *    - kIndoorAtlasPositioningStateConnected
 *
 *      Positioner is connected to the positioning server. Connection has not been prepared.
 *      This state only emits when connected first time to the server.
 *
 *    - kIndoorAtlasPositioningStateLoading
 *
 *      Server is preparing for positioning.
 *      This state only emits when connected to the server.
 *
 *    - kIndoorAtlasPositioningStateReady
 *
 *      Positioner is ready to start positioning.
 *      This state only emits when prepared.
 *
 *    - kIndoorAtlasPositioningStateWaitingForFix
 *
 *      Positioner has sent first positiong query and is waiting for a location fix.
 *      This state only emits when started.
 *
 *    - kIndoorAtlasPositioningStatePositioning
 *
 *      Positioner is receiving and sending positioning data.
 *      This state only emits when positioning is active.
 *
 *    - kIndoorAtlasPositioningStateBuffering
 *
 *      Positioning data is being buffered at the client, most likely because of network problem.
 *      The connection may still recover from this state to positioning.
 *      This state may emit during positioning.
 *

 *
 *      Positioning data is being heavily buffered at the client, most likely becuase of severe network problem.
 *      The connection may still recover from this state to positioning.
 *      This state may emit during positioning.
